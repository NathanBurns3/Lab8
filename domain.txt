Run-length encoding is well-suited for repetitive data. When there are a lot of recurring characters
it makes the compression more efficient. When there are a lot of spaces or non-repetitive characters
it makes it harder to decompress and not a lot is changed to the file. A real-world example of data
being well-suited for run-length encoding would be bitmap images. These bitmap images often have
repetitive pixels of the same value that could easily be compressed using run-length encoding.
