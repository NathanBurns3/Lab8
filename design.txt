1. have the format_compression_ratio and data_available functions precreated
2. create the compression_ratio_calculation function
    2a. divide the deCodeLength by the preCodeLength
    2b. call the format_compression_ratio and use the division result as the argument
    2c. print the result to the console
3. create the print_decompression function
    3a. loop through the char vector
    3b. print to the console and increase the decompression counter
    3c. print a new line
4. initialize the following variables:
    decode - vector of chars
    numberOfCharacters - int
    character - char
    character2 - char
    preCodeLength - double
    deCodeLength - double
    charNumbers - array of characters with numbers 1-9
5. initialize the input file and open int
6. check if the file failed
    6a. if so then print out the error message and end the program
7. while there is still data in the file:
8. store the number into numberOfCharacters and check if its equivalent to 0
    8a. if it is then print an error message and end the program
9. increment preCodeLength
10. check if the number greater than 9
    10a. if it is then increment preCodeLength
11. check if there is data available in the file
    11a. if there is not then print an error message and end the program
12. store the character in the character variable
13. checker if the numberOfCharacters variable is greater than 10
    13a. if it is then print an error message and end the program
14. increment the preCodeLength variable
15. check if the character variable is a '-'
    15a. if it is then check if there is more data in the file
        15a1. if there isn't then print an error message and end the program
    15b. take in the next character and store it in the character2 variable
    15c. check if the character2 variable is equivalent to 0
        15c1. if it is then print an error message and end the program
    15d. increment the preCodeLength variable
    15e. use a for loop to add character2 numberOfCharacters times to the decode vector
16. if the character is not a '-' then use a for loop to add character numberOfCharacters tiems to the decode vector
17. call the print_decompression function and use decode and deCodeLength as the arguments
18. call the compression_ratio_calculation function and use deCodeLength and preCodeLength and the arguments
